# CityRec

CityRec is a prototype travel recommender system for cities. It was developed to conduct a user study in the scope of a Masterâ€™s thesis at the Technical University of Munich (TUM).

## Running the application

1. Clone the repo
2. Install Docker
3. run docker-compose up --build in the root directory

Note that a large part of this prototype was developed during a very short period of time due to time limitations, therefore, there is room for improvement in the code quality and structure in some parts of the implementation.

Some screenshots of the application are shown below:
