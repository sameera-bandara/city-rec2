# CityRec

CityRec is a prototype travel recommender system for cities. It was developed to conduct a user study in the scope of a Masterâ€™s thesis at the Technical University of Munich (TUM).

Some screenshots of the application are shown below:

## Running the application

1. Clone the repo
2. Install Docker
3. run docker-compose up --build in the root directory

Note that a large part of this prototype was developed during a very short period of time due to time limitations, therefore, there is room for improvement in the code quality and structure in some parts of the implementation.
